# Battleship Game

## Introduction

This Game is my first project. I did it in week 3 at Ironhack. The game consists in a sea battle. You have 90 seconds to shoot the submarines for points, but be aware of their torpedos ;).

## Setup

If youâ€™d like to view my project in your browser:

git clone https://github.com/pedrocncosta/Project_1_WWII.git
open index.html

enjoy ;)
